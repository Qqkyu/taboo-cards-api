# Taboo cards API

Server that communicates with a database of around ~2000 taboo cards, each in two languages - English and Polish.

## Models

Card:

| Attribute      |   Type   | Description                               |
| -------------- | :------: | ----------------------------------------- | ------ | --------------------- |
| title          |  string  | Word to explain                           |
| forbiddenWords | string[] | Words that can't be used to explain title |
| difficulty     |  "easy"  | "medium"                                  | "hard" | Subjective difficulty |

## Example cards

English:

```json
{
  "forbiddenWords": ["New York", "torch", "crown", "sculpture", "island"],
  "title": "Statue of Liberty",
  "difficulty": "medium"
}
```

Corresponding Polish card:

```json
{
  "forbiddenWords": [
    "Nowy Jork",
    "Stany Zjednoczone",
    "prezent",
    "wyspa",
    "pochodnia"
  ],
  "title": "Statua Wolno≈õci",
  "difficulty": "medium"
}
```

## Endpoints

There are currently two endpoints, both with the language query parameter. Parameter options are "pl" and "en". However, it is optional and will default to "en".

First endpoint returns all of the cards stored in the database.

```
/api/cards
/api/cards?language=en
/api/cards?language=pl
```

In the above example, first two paths will return the same response.

Second one randomly chooses one card and returns it:

```
/api/cards/random
/api/cards/random?language=en
/api/cards/random?language=pl
```

Same as in the first example, first two paths will give the same response.
